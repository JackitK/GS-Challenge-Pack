# GS-Challenge-Pack
Welcome to the Golden Sun Challenge Run Kit.  Need a little spice for your next run of Golden Sun? Then this challenge pack is for you. It contains a variety of patches that vary from making certain challenge runs easier to set up, to modifications for custom rulesets. You can set up runs where you can't use summons, where you're forced to use only a single element, and more.  If you're craving something extra spicy, you can check out my custom made challenge patch with stronger enemies, customized bosses, and other surprises.

There's even a no-summon patch for the current Dawn of Djinn Second Mix demo, for people craving for more Dawn of Djinn to hold them over to the final Version 2.0 release.

# Challenge Types (By Filename):

## Base Patches (Should be applied first if they are to be used)

- MonoFire: All Psynergy, Djinn, weapons, and summons you have access to will be of fire or netural elemental power. Preventing you from having access to any other elements for attack, excluding battle items. All party members will start as fire adapts by default. Some classes have had altered Djinn requirements to still be accessible in this new mode; though you still will be unable to create certain classes, such as the Squire line.

- MonoWater: All Psynergy, Djinn, weapons, and summons you have access to will be of water or netural elemental power. Preventing you from having access to any other elements for attack, excluding battle items. All party members will start as water adapts by default. Some classes have had altered Djinn requirements to still be accessible in this new mode; though you still will be unable to create certain classes, such as the Squire line.


## Add-Ons (Should be applied after base patches. Can also be played on their own.)

- NoSummon: Turns all summons into the "Nothing" command. This immediately ends the user's turn without doing damage. However, it still treated as a summon in the sense of putting Djinn into recovery and give the user an elemental boost. This patch also comes with the Death Charm item, for those that want to do this challenge as a solo run as well.

- DeathCharm: Applies every party member with an item called "Death Charm" when they join the party. When used in battle, it'll instantly down the user.  This item is intended to help make it easier to knock out your party members when doing something like a solo Party Character run. However, how exactly you use this item to spice up your challenge run is up to you.

- TLA-HardMode: Applies stat boosts to enemies and bosses in a way similar to how it was handled in The Lost Age's "hard mode". Specifically, enemy HP is increased by 50%, and enemy Attack and Defense are each increased by 25%. Special thanks to @empty_set on the Golden Sun Modding Discord for this patch.

## Dawn of Djinn Patches:
Custom challenge patches that tie into the ROM Hack I'm making of Golden Sun, Golden Sun Dawn of Djinn. 

Dawn of Djinn is my upcoming custom ROM Hack of Golden Sun 1 with way too many new features and updates to list them all here. Check out the Golden Sun Dawn of Djinn page for more information. Long story short, it's very different and significantly harder than the orginal game. 

Despite being modified version of Dawn of Djinn these should be applied to a clean GS 1 ROM as well. Add-On patches may have unintended results to the ROM due to the way Dawn of Djinn is built compared to the orginal game. Quailty of Life patches, however should be fine, though Dawn of Djinn already has the prolouge events of the game removed.

- DoD_NoSummon: Dawn of Djinn demo up to Mogall forest, that also removes the ability to do summons. This was quickly put together for the fun of it and has not been play tested at all. So I could not tell you off the top of my head if this is even beatable, let alone how much harder this makes the game. Player disgreation is advised.
