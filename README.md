# GS-Challenge-Pack
Welcome to the Golden Sun Challenge Run Kit.  Need a little spice for your next run of Golden Sun? Then I have you covered. This package contains a variety of patches that vary from making certain challenge runs easier to set up, to modifications for custom rulesets. You can set up runs where you can't use summons, where you're forced to use only a single element, and more.  If you're craving something extra spicy, you can check out my custom made challenge patch with stronger enemies, customized bosses, and other surprises.

There's even a no-summon patch for the current Dawn of Djinn Second Mix demo, for people craving for more Dawn of Djinn to hold them over to the final Version 2.0 release.

# Installation/Set-up:
- Select the patch of the type of challenge you'd like to add.
	- See challenge types for more detail of what each patch offers.
- Apply the patch to your ROM via a tool such as Lunar IPS.
	## Disclaimer:
  Patch must be applied to a clean US ROM of Golden Sun 1.  Applying this patch to other mods may result in techincal glitches.
  Patches that would work on an already modded ROM, such as the auto run and cutscene skip patches, can be applied afterwords without techincal difficulites.

# Challenge Types (By Filename):
- SoloRun: Makes doing solo runs easier by having each party member come with a "Death Charm". This item will instantly down the user when used.

- NoSummon: Turns all summons into the "Nothing" command. This immediately ends the user's turn without doing damage. However, it still treated as a summon in the sense of putting Djinn into recovery and give the user an elemental boost. This patch also comes with the Death Charm item, for those that want to do this challenge as a solo run as well.

- MonoFire: All Psynergy, Djinn, weapons, and summons you have access to will be of fire or netural elemental power. Preventing you from having access to any other elements for attack, excluding battle items. All party members will start as fire adapts by default. Some classes have had altered Djinn requirements to still be accessible in this new mode; though you still will be unable to create certain classes, such as the Squire line.
Also includes the Death Charm in case you wish to do a Solo run.

- MonoFire_NoSummon: A combination of the NoSummon and MonoFire patches. Allowing you to do a mono fire challenge run without access to summons. Also includes the Death Charm in case you wish to do a Solo run.

- MonoWater: All Psynergy, Djinn, weapons, and summons you have access to will be of water or netural elemental power. Preventing you from having access to any other elements for attack, excluding battle items. All party members will start as water adapts by default. Some classes have had altered Djinn requirements to still be accessible in this new mode; though you still will be unable to create certain classes, such as the Squire line.
Also includes the Death Charm in case you wish to do a Solo run.

- MonoFire_NoSummon: A combination of the NoSummon and MonoFire patches. Allowing you to do a mono water challenge run without access to summons. Also includes the Death Charm in case you wish to do a Solo run.

- JackitKSpice: Custom made challenge mode by me. Enemies have a boost similar to the Lost Age Hard Mode. Bosses have been personally taliored to be more challenging. Also includes death charms for optional solo runs. There may be other surprises you'll have to play to find out.

- JackitKSpice_noSummon: The JackitK Spice, now without summons. Just in case the normal spice isn't enough for you.

## Dawn of Djinn Patches:
Custom challenge patches that tie into the ROM Hack I'm making of Golden Sun, Golden Sun Dawn of Djinn. These despite being modified version of Dawn of Djinn these should be applied to a clean GS 1 ROM as well...
- DoD_NoSummon: Dawn of Djinn demo up to Mogall forest, that also removes the ability to do summons.  Dawn of Djinn is my upcoming custom ROM Hack of Golden Sun 1 with way too many new features and updates to list them all here. Check out the Golden Sun Dawn of Djinn page for more information. Long story short, it's very different and significantly harder than the orginal game.  This was quickly put together for the fun of it and has not been play tested to see how much harder removing summons makes it. So if you do try it out, let me know if it's beatable. Saves me the trouble of finding out.
